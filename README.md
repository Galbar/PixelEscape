INSTRUCTIONS
------------
You control a pixel in a colored level divided by cells. The pixel is divided into 3 colors: red, green and blue. A color is killed if it runs over a cell which contains its same color. By combining the 3 colors, we can get a total of 7 possible colors: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow and white, being the last four a combination of the 3 basic colors. The objective is to get to the goal cell, marked in soft grey, with the color that the same cell indicates, being it one of the 7 colors written earlier.

With "W,A,S,D" you can control the pixel. If you click the number keys "1", "2", "3" you can switch between red, green and blue colors, respectively. That means that if you select a color, it will be disjoint from the rest of the pixel, and it will move independently.
To make 2 or more colors join again, position them on the same cell and click "J". If you have 2 colors joint, you can select them (together) by clicking the number key "4".
Click "R" to restart the level. Click "P" to pause and resume the game.
